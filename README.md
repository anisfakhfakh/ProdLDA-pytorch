# Autoencoding Variational Inference For Topic Models [PyTorch]
A repository of an unofficial implementation of the method described in the [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01488) .
My other projects will be porgressively uploaded at the [main GitHub repo](https://github.com/anisfakhfakh).

#### -- Project Status: [Complete]

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to code an implementation of the ProdLDA model as described on the paper.

### Methods Used
* Deep learning
* Variational Bayesian Inference
* Bayesian models
* Mean-field approximation
* Natural language Processing
* etc.


## Project Description
The project uses the data: 20 news dataset and implements the descibed model calculating the Perplexity of the model while testing.
The data was already preprocessed and tokenized then downloaded from external source to use directly.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo.
2. Change Hyperparameters in main.py with argparser
3. Run main.py for training and testing
